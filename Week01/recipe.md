# Crispy Pork Belly
Delicious, if you ignore the cholesterol.

## Ingredient List
- A strip of pork belly with skin-on
- Peanut oil or sunflower oil
- 1 cup kosher salt
- 1/2 tbsp white pepper
- 1/2 tbsp five spice powder
- 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp shaoxing wine
- 1 egg white beaten
- 1 tbsp white vinegar

## Directions
1. Dry the pork belly with the skin exposed in the fridge for at least 24 hours
2. Pat the pork belly skin dry and poke holes all across the skin. 
3. Cut 1/2" cuts lengthwise across the pork belly. In a small bowl, mix salt, white papper, five spice powder, sugar, and shaoxing wine to make a paste. Evenly spread the paste on the meat side of the pork and crevices, don't touch the skin.
4. Place the punctured and marinated pork on a piece of foil and wrap it, leave the skin exposed. Place in the bridge for at least 24 hours to help the skin further dry out.
5. Mix together salt and a beaten egg white. Brush the skin with a layer of white vinegar, then evenly layer the salt-egg mixture directly on the skin.
6. Bake at 300F for 30 minutes, then brush off the salt from the skin. Poke more holes throughout the  skin for extra crisp.
7. Bake at 450F for another 30-45 minutes. Enjoy.
