        <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A strip of pork belly with skin-on</li>
                <li>Peanut oil or sunflower oil</li>
                <li>1 cup kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp white pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp five spice powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp shaoxing wine</li>
                <li>1 egg white beaten</li>
                <li>1 tbsp white vinegar</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Dry the pork belly with the skin exposed in the fridge for at least 24 hours</li>
                <li>Pat the pork belly skin dry and poke holes all across the skin. </li>
                <li>Cut 1/2" cuts lengthwise across the pork belly. In a small bowl, mix salt, white papper, five spice powder, sugar, and shaoxing wine to make a paste. Evenly spread the paste on the meat side of the pork and crevices, don't touch the skin.</li>
                <li>Place the punctured and marinated pork on a piece of foil and wrap it, leave the skin exposed. Place in the bridge for at least 24 hours to help the skin further dry out.</li>
                <li>Mix together salt and a beaten egg white. Brush the skin with a layer of white vinegar, then evenly layer the salt-egg mixture directly on the skin.</li>
                <li>Bake at 300F for 30 minutes, then brush off the salt from the skin. Poke more holes throughout the  skin for extra crisp.</li>
                <li>Bake at 450F for another 30-45 minutes. Enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
