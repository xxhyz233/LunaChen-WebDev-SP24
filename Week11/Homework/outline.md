# Final Project Outline
For the Final I wish to <b>continue with my Midterm ideas </b>and refine / add new functions to my existing portfolio website, and hopefully by the end of this class it becomes functional and actually hosted on a server.

## Here's what I have in mind technically with JavaScript so far:
1. Refine the existing image fullscreen JS by adding animation and work information
2. Add a fullscreeen script for videos without sound (for the ones with sound I wanna keep the original media player (IDK what it's called))
3. Modify the embeded Processing works so they don't lag the INTERACTIVE page 
4. Figure out the script of [this header](https://refikanadol.com/works/machine-hallucinations-nature-dreams/) where it smoothly fades out when I scroll down and fades in when I scroll up
5. Add a script that allows HTML elements to [fade in and fade out](https://verse-n.com/) whenever I enter a new page
6. Add a loading animation for large media files

## Aesthetically I wish to:
1. Adjust the layout of the film page with info on the right, about + process on the left, and title on the top aligned to the center
2. Add a work process video backdrop on the INFO page + adjust layout
3. Find a more uniform hover animation for the footer icons
